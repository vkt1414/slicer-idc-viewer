3. Restart Slicer
4. Open a URL like `slicer://viewer/?download=$seriesinstanceuid` for example
   ```
   slicer://viewer/?download=1.2.840.113654.2.55.154809705591242159075253605419469935510
   ```
    ### Prerequisties for Ubuntu users: 
    This method requires registering slicer:// as custom web protocol.
    On windows, slicer installation automatically registers custom web protocol for slicer. 
    However, on Ubuntu, edit the `register_slicer_protocol.sh.edit` script to provide the location of the Slicer binary.
    ```
    nano register_slicer_protocol.sh.edit
    ```
    save it as register_slicer_protocol.sh
    
    
    Make this file an executable
    ```
    chmod +x register_slicer_protocol.sh
    ```
    Run the script
    ```
    ./register_slicer_protocol.sh
    ```
